Mike Klepper's solution to the KBRA code screen problem

Solution is written in JS, intended to be ran within a browser.

To run it, open index.html in a browser - tested on Chrome or Safari on Mac OS X

Features:
* Dynamically-generated test-case UI is included at top
* Next comes a free-form input where start and end times can be entered
* The BellCounter object is packaged in scripts/BellCounter.js
* BellCounter includes a private input validation method
* Rest of the code is a test framework I use for quickie UI work, so it is pretty generic
